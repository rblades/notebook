Combatting feature creep - want the digital to be a part of the history, not just add cool features for the hell of it, but add then for userbility, clean interface, etc. Angular does just this - avoid linear and hyperlinking. There were a lot of features I wanted to add that I did not move forward with because they would be fluff - cool, but ultimately inauthentic for this historical digital landscape.

Structuring the code for future operability, deprecation, cross-platform usage, quick load times; less memory-heavy tasks (people could be using older computers, older browsers). I'm operating under the assumption that people are using updated browsers (now, major browsers will support html5.

Deprecation of digital projects: hosted on github. Uses hosted api libraries where I could.
