>It feels to me as if our practise as humanists and historians is being driven by the technology, rather than being served by it.

We are being driven by it only if we refuse to understand its structure and purpose and then critique it and our understanding of it. Hitchcock is trying to show that these tools have much longer histories entangled within them. Our job is not to un-entangle, but to understand these tools and the entanglement (We are trying to understand entanglement from within the entanglement).
