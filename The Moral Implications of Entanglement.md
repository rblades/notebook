Hodder (96) says that entanglement accounts for the chronology of things and the debts, obligations, etc. they pick up along the way: so my sounds I record at the woodshop will involve this notion

I have to accept the moral implication that this history thus gets my own positive experience of the sounds of the woodshop entangled with it. This is a historiographical mantra I must show you.

My readings of Hodder and Ingold were initially meant to explore sound historically phenomenologically in Pembroke, reflecting on the long duree. Yet through my research process, as more becomes apparent to me, I realize it has more an important implication for my reflexivity as a historian.

And Hodder implies that it is not (should not) be our task to untangle the past. We would be better off trying to iron down the mess than untangle it one string at a time. He argues (222) that entanglement â€œis about being caught up in real things in specific ways that come about through complex interactions. It is not bounded, schematic, theoretical. It describes the ways in which we live our lives struggling between webs of demand and potential, making do, working it out, unclear what is happening much of the time, not knowing the results of our actions and why. We can never mop up all this mess."
