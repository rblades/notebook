Everything has a history. As Hitchcock notes, DH historicity = ideas of codebreaking and 'cracking' from the 20th century. We fall into those same tropes and traps. In my own work on sound studies, this is particularly true of my map: listening has a history formed by years of  recorded noise. (Though for Ingold this is not the case necessarily since we have a biological history as well.) Reproducing recorded sounds digitally just reinforces traditional means of historical study rather than challenging it
