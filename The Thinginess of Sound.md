Ian Hodder writes in *Entangled* about ubiquity (pp. 102-103)

*we tend to forget the history of things because: we do not need to know how something works until it breaks down
*we work without knowing the histories of things; our habitual routinization with things; working of things are often hidden; the strings of entanglement are often so long and complex and chaotic that we cannot monitor them; because of different temporalities; entanglements transform based on their use; things become distanced on place and time â€” this can all be said for sound; we become so accustomed to it
