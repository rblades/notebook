What I heard had good value. Loud or even distressing noises were good to my ears because it meant success. To others, it may hurt their ears, annoy them, stress them, bring about bad memories.Â  

How to make subjectivity of sounds problematic by implicit in map? First, read my audience: shoe that these are recreated sounds. That will get them thinking about sound historically and not as these as timeless sounds. I feel actual workers will be more critical, least I can only hope. It's the other publics I have to worry about.
