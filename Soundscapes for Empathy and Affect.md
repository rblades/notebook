Phenomenology is the best approach in my view because it looks at sound through experience.  This is limited of course because it is *only* human experience. It is also a view of the world created by western philosophy, not used by the best people (i.e. Heidegger was a Nazi).

Phenomenology, though, captures the essence of empathy: that all we can do is listen, but not get caught up in ourselves. To listen to others, to see that there is always an audience, however 'small' or 'limited' it may be. And do understand that they may not hear the same as you, but nevertheless they listen too.
