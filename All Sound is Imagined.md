The philosopher Don Ihde wrote in *Listening and Voice* (1976) that 
*119: There is an imaginative mode to hearing
*122: remembering sound is an imaginative act that implies inner experience - imaginative acts implicate the self 

Similarly Mark Grimshaw and Tom Garner write in *Sonic Virtuality* (2014) that sound waves do not produce sound; rather, sound is imagined and we offload it into our environments
