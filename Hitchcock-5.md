There is an element of augmented reality in the layers of these digital sources. A source code is emulated as an interface. It is easy, then, to get caught up in the habit of clicking and getting. Digital humanists must learn the dirty art of doing the work themselves, least seeing how it is constructed. As much as there are digital tools for historical data, we need tools to help us understand underlying code structures.
