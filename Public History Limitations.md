A thought process regarding open access and publics: 

1. My project is purportedly *open access*
2. I assume that more access is a better thing
3. After examination, it seems that the *open access* aspect of this project is much more limited than the 'utopic' abstract notion of that phrase purports.  
4. *Open access* means information can reach a wider *public*
5. But *the public* is in fact a myriad of small publics I create through this project, mostly white, male academics.
6. Therefore, because this public is so much smaller and the ideal of open access is that a wider public is a good thing, my public(s) is(are) limited
7. My Public History is limited and therefore, not as good as if it reached more people
