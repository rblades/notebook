It's easy to forget that these have years of evolution behind them, designed for reasons; we have to be careful not to over estimate ourselves and the 'digital revolution'. As Hitchcock notes in the first quote above, we have been trained in these methods because they work. This is not random. There are reasons we do these things. The positivist outlook we should also avoid that Hitchcock implies is that the digital is what we have been waiting for to 'crack' the proverbial humanist code.
