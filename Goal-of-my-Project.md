Different goals of each soundscape projects:

- Field of Sounds to evoke nostalgia, record ambience in space

- New York to track the negative impact of sounds in growing urban areas

- Ottoman Soundscapes to understand sound within space, the power of sound in urban organization, how places *might have* sounded

- Baths of Neptune to understand how sound generally plays in space vs. the actual content of noise

- https://foundsounds.me/ is the pinnacle of Schafer's project

These projects all focus on space and sound
